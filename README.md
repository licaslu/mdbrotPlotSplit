# mdbrotPlotSplit
Mandelbrot Set Plotter with a sectional splitter

I made this in Class Pls don't judge.

Did not have time to implement threading

The Plotter takes a range and a node number to plot, producing a pickle file.

The Combiner puts the pickle files together.

Both are very ram/cpu heavy because none of this was optimized.


Thank you Dr. Gray for providing a working model for this to run on.
